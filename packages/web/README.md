# Cosmos Smart Contract Explorer Proposal
Name: ? (blockhopper, chainhopper, chainex, explorer, cosmexplorer, cosmhopper, )




## Phase 1
* Osmosis chain support
* Cosmos (maybe neutron) chain support
* ?? chain support
* Compile proto library of chain
* Allow for github repo linking to add your smart contract (how to do for private repos?)
* Compile of Instantiate, ExecuteMsg, and QueryMsg types to protos -> to jsonschema for UI
* UI search bar for arbitrary contract addresses 
* Seed explorer with already-deployed & open source contracts
* send queries to RPC node & display results
* send arbitrary transactions through keplr
* testnet chain support?

## Phase 2
* continuous deployment (update proto defs daily from github)
* code generation 

## Phase 3
* in-browser CosmWasm Repl for easy testing
*
